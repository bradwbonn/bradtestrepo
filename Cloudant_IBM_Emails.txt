Morning / Afternoon / Evening Cloudants -

It has been an exciting day with great news coverage about the announcement and positive feedback from the market (customers, partners, analysts, etc...).  For you, I am sure the news has not totally sunk in and that as time passes you have more questions or thoughts about what this all means.  I totally understand.   

As I said during our ALL HANDS meeting, we are working hard to now move to close the transaction with IBM over the next couple of days.  Once this occurs, we will be able to provide much more detail as it relates to what life will be like at IBM and what this transaction means to you.

If you have any questions or want to talk about anything, please reach out to me via IRC, email or come by my office.  I am more than happy to talk.

Again, today is an incredibly exciting day in our company's life and I can't wait to start the next chapter with all of you as a part of IBM.

Best,

Derek
